#### 4. Publish Docker container
After the build is finished, your Docker image will be ready in "Packages" menu which is a submenu under "Code" tab. You can find the image path there. Something like that:

docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/username/sample-dotnet/primeapps-sample:1.0.0
```

You can now create a container in PrimeApps Studio using this information..
